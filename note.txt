4) second_move(): is for first move by player2.
5) third_move(): is for first (non-random) move by player1.
6) game continues by next_move()
7) last_move() is called when opponent wins with the move.
8) win/loss() to show how player won or lost.
9) end() to indicate that the game has been completed.
